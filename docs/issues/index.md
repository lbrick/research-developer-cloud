# Issues

We want to be open about the current and resolved issues with the RDC.

This will list the issues that we are aware of and when we do a release to fix a known issue we will link that release notes with the resolved issues.

If you do discover any issues with the RDC that are not listed here please let us know via email at [support@cloud.nesi.org.nz](mailto:support@cloud.nesi.org.nz?subject=NeSI's%20Research%20Developer%20Cloud%20Issues)
